# VR Files

Navigate your computer's files in VR.

* Install using `npm install`
* Make security keys and call them `key.pem` and `cert.pem` (otherwise update the file `https.conf.js` accordingly)
* Start using `npm start`
* In your VR headset, point the Web browser to the IP of your computer, for example, `https://192.168.1.10:8080`. Port has to be `8080`.
* Done!
